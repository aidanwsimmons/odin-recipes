    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken tikka masala is usually made with heavy cream, but I like to use coconut milk instead; its subtle sweetness works beautifully with the spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
      <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 can coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Place chicken in a bowl. Drizzle vegetable oil
        over chicken; toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric,
        black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom in a small bowl. Sprinkle
        over chicken and turn to coat evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Cook
        chicken thighs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10
        minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut
        chicken into bite-sized pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Place the skillet with chicken drippings over medium-high
        heat. Stir onion into the skillet; saut√© until onion softens and turns
        translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste
        caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger into tomato-onion
        mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping
        the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden
        spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, reduce
        heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend
        and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir chicken and any accumulated juices into sauce. Add cilantro and red
        pepper flakes; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook
        until chicken is cooked through and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season
        with salt and black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
